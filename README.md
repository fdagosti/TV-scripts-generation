# TV-scripts-generation
This repo is using a Recurrent Neural Network to predict future simpsons episodes based on the scripts for the previous episodes

# Installation
This is a jupyter notebook with tensorflow on it.

The current notebook was run on an AWS EC2 instance with GPU to speed up the computation. It took less than 5 minutes to train it (although the training loss is pretty high...)
